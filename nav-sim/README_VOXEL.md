# Voxel navigation sim — build and run

Plain C++17 + OpenCV. No ROS, no Gazebo, no GPU, no Python. Builds and runs the
same on Windows 11, Linux and macOS.

## Windows 11

Install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) once, then:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install opencv4[core,imgproc,imgcodecs,highgui]:x64-windows

cd nav-sim
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\voxel_sim.exe --world forest --display
```

If you would rather not use vcpkg, download the prebuilt OpenCV Windows release,
unzip it, and point CMake at it:

```powershell
cmake -B build -DOpenCV_DIR=C:/opencv/build/x64/vc16/lib
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Add `C:\opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin` to `PATH` so the DLLs are found at runtime.

Visual Studio users: `cmake -B build` then open `build\nav_sim.sln`.

## Linux / macOS

```bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev cmake build-essential   # or: brew install opencv cmake
cd nav-sim && cmake -B build && cmake --build build -j
./build/voxel_sim --world forest --display
```

## Running

`--display` opens a live window with three panes and a status bar:

| pane | shows |
|---|---|
| **TRUTH + flown path** | the real world at the current flight height, the flown trail in red, the current A\* path in green, goal circle |
| **VOXEL MAP slice** | what the aircraft actually believes — white free, black occupied, **grey unknown** |
| **DEPTH** | the depth image being fed in; grey pixels are where stereo found no match |

Keys: `space` pause/step, `q` or `Esc` quit.

```
voxel_sim --world forest|city     which world
          --goal E N U            goal in metres
          --truth                 perfect depth instead of simulated stereo  <-- ALWAYS RUN THIS
          --general-only          reactive layer only, no A*
          --cell 0.25             voxel size, m
          --steps 900             step limit (dt = 0.1 s)
          --replan 25             A* replan interval, steps
          --display               live GUI
          --out /tmp/nav          PNG output prefix
```

Exit code: `0` reached goal, `1` ran out of steps, `2` collided.

## Always run `--truth` as a control

The single most useful habit with this harness. Perfect depth removes the sensor
from the experiment:

* fails with `--truth` → **the planner is broken**
* works with `--truth`, fails without → **the map is the limit**, and the number
  you are looking at is a sensor result rather than a bug

Three real planner bugs were found this way within minutes of the harness first
running, each of which would have been invisible without the control:

1. Speed was gated on unknown-discounted *openness*, so an entirely unmapped
   direction scored ~6.6 m of "clearance" and the aircraft flew into a tree at
   1.5 m/s on step 18 — with perfect depth.
2. Replacing that with a *threshold* on confirmed-free range deadlocked: in
   dense forest the free run sits near 2 m, so "stop below 2 m" meant stop
   forever, and you cannot see further without moving. It is a stopping-distance
   budget, not a threshold.
3. Direction was scored on openness while speed was gated on free range, so the
   planner chose whichever direction held the most *unseen* space — precisely
   the direction with the least room to move into — and then refused to move.

## Status — read this before trusting a number

**The harness works. The planners do not yet fly reliably.** Current matrix,
900 steps:

```
world/depth      outcome        travelled   min clearance   false-free
forest/truth     COLLIDED          98.7 m          0.25 m       0.000%
forest/stereo    COLLIDED           0.5 m          0.25 m       2.444%
city/truth       deadlocked         0.0 m          2.00 m       0.000%
city/stereo      timeout          311.0 m          0.80 m       0.018%
```

Only `city/stereo` behaves — it flies 311 m without hitting anything but does not
reach the goal. The forest runs still collide and the city truth run still
deadlocks, so at least two more bugs are in there. The escape behaviour added for
bug 3 is the prime suspect: it abandons the goal whenever free room is short,
which in dense forest is most of the time, so the aircraft wanders instead of
committing.

What *is* established: the map itself is sound (false-free is 0.000% with truth
depth in every world), the collision scoring is honest (it is measured against
`VoxelWorld`, never against the map the planner used), and the harness surfaces
real bugs quickly.
